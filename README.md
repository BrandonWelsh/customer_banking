## Program Goals
To create "a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months." (Bootcamp Spot Module 3 Challenge instructions)

## Resources Utilized
This section is dedicated to keep track of what I used to help complete this program.

50% class notes

45% AI powered by OpenAI's GPT 3.5

5% Asking classmates questions in slack.

While I tried to use the class notes as often as possible, I was frequently getting caught up on syntax and turned to an AI tool, mostly queries along the lines of "This is a small chunk of my code, this is what isn't working, help me re-write this so it works". As for the questions I asked in Slack, I didn't ask any programming questions this time around, but mostly asked if anyone had their interest calculations identical like mine was. Spoilers: everyone came to the same conclusion that the instructions did not specify if we should have different formulas so we used the same formula for both CD and savings.

## Bugs
I tried several methods to check the user input and ensure the input was a float or an integer (or else the program just crashes). However, every method I tried was screwing something up. Since the instructions didn't explicitly tell me I needed to have this, and in an effort to avoid completely borking this program, I'm just gonna send it.

Another thing that isn't really a bug but still bugs me (haha pun haha god almighty) is that the formula to calculate savings interest earned is identical to calculating CD interest earned. IRL the only difference between these two accounts is the interest rate and penalties for early withdrawal The former is entered by the user and the latter is not a thing in this program so I'm also just gonna send it.

## Update Log
11/11/2023: Began initial work on project, which included creating github repository. Got everything set up and added the import functions.

11/12/2023: Spent like 6 hours and worked through much of the project. But it isN'T DONE AGH. Uploading a complete but non-functional copy to github before I go through and change a bunch of stuff.

11/12/2023 (part 2 electric boogaloo): Tried to relax, play some cyberpunk, couldn't relax, came back to finish this stupid thing. Uploading a complete and functional (but I don't think is right) copy to github. I will figure it out later.

11/13/2023: Spent class time asking two questions I had. Answers satisfactory, apparently my program is already done and I'm just paranoid. However I am too exhausted to proofread and fine tune it right now so I'll do all that tomorrow.

11/14/2023: Uploading final copy.

11/15/2023: I know I already submitted this on bootcampspot but we're still within the due date and there was some formatting things I wanted changed. Also wanted to update the README a little.
