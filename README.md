## Program Goals
To create "a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months." (Bootcamp Spot Module 3 Challenge instructions)

## Resources Utilized
This section is dedicated to keep track of what I used to help complete this program.

## Update Log
11/11/2023: Began initial work on project, which included creating github repository. Got everything set up and added the import functions.

11/12/2023: Worked through much of the project. Uploading a complete but non-functional copy to github before I go through and change a bunch of stuff.
